# Design Patterns
Generic C# examples demonstrating structural code and key ideas of design patterns from the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]

### Project Structure
Structural code examples can be found under the DesignPatterns folder, separated into the following 3 categories, with one folder per design pattern:

  - [Behavioural examples]
  - [Creational examples]
  - [Structural examples]

Usage of the structural examples (in the format of [NUnit] tests) can be found under DesignPatters.UnitTests folders, and are also separated into the following 3 categories, with one file per design pattern:

  - [Behavioural tests]
  - [Creational tests]
  - [Structural tests]
